<h1>Reckless</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Hey, this is a story I hate</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">And telling it might make me break</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">But I'll tell it anyway</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">This chapter's about</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">How you said there was nobody else</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Then you got up and went to her house</P>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">You guys always left me out</p>
<br>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I still have the letter you wrote</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">When you told me that I was the only girl</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">You'd ever want in your life</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I guess my friends were right</p>
<br>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Each day goes by and each night, I cry</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Somebody saw you with her last night</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her"</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">You might love her now, but you loved me first</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Oh, you swore on every star</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">How could you be so reckless with my heart?</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">How could you be so reckless?</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">How could you be so reckless with someone's heart?</p>
